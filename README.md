So this is first coding project that i wrote in React.
It's about using a library that has trained models for detection
objects from our camera mobile device.


I created app boilerplate from create-react-app and it's running on port 3000
You can start it with npm start and then you need ngrok with command that expose your running port => ngrok http 3000,
when you get address go and visit with your mobile phone.

So in this project i learn some new things about canvas configuration and I got introduced to React and read something about
this libraries.
Thanks @Jackie-Tan for great tutorial.
